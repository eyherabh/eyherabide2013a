    % DESCRIPTION:
    %
    % Calculates the Shannon mutual information between the stimulus and the
    % population response.
    %
    % This function is currently limited to populations of 2 neurons.
    %
    % INPUT ARGUMENTS:
    %
    %   - psr1r2: the JOINT stimulus-response probability distribution
    %   (P(R1,R2,S), not P(R1,R2|S)). It must be a matrix of size KxNxM, with
    %   K stimuli, N possible values for responses elicited by neuron R1
    %   and M possible values for responses elicited by neuron R2.
    %
    % EXAMPLE:
    %
    % psr1r2(1,1,2)=.25;
    % psr1r2(1,2,1)=.25;
    % psr1r2(2,2,2)=.25;
    % psr1r2(2,3,3)=.25;
    %
